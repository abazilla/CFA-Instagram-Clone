# Instagram Clone 

As part of learning Ruby on Rails and the MVC at CFA, I have attempted to create Instagram. It has the ability to create posts with a picture, and the key gems used include socialization for social features (liking, following), and paperclip for image upload. The feed is also formatted to look similar to instagram.
